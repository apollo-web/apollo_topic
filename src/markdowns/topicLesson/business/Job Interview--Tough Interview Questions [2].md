“When I was asked to step in as a temporary team leader for the first time, I still remember how I missed a couple of key communications from the manager. This pushed our deadlines back by 2 weeks. It was a great lesson and since then, I always make it a point to focus on the big-picture, instead of looking at smaller projects.”- A2.  
“Recently, the company that I work for, inaugurated a new store. On the day of the opening, the air conditioning of the outlet failed. In order to keep all the new customers comfortable, I immediately cracked the idea of organizing a sidewalk open-air sale! It was a life saver as the shop was super-hot inside. This is an example of how resourceful and creative I can be when the situation demands!”
