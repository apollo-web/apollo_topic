### Sample answers
- A1.  
“I have several strengths namely ? I am patient, committed, honest and self-motivated. I am the biggest dreamer I have ever come across! I forgive easily and hate to keep grudges in my heart. My greatest weakness is that I don't like getting interrupted when I am seriously into something. Another one of my weaknesses is that I trust people very easily. As I already said, I am a very patient person, so I am actively working on this lacuna.”- A2.  
“You might think that since I have never worked in my life, and this is only my first job, my inexperience is my weakness. But I beg to differ. I am a fast learner and very open minded. I assure that I do not carry any pre-conceived notions regarding how I feel I should perform my job.”
