### Talk about it

### Sample answers
- A1.  
“I have never been a great public speaker. The very thought of facing a crowd used to make me nervous. When I started college, my best friend advised me that I had to get over this roadblock to shine through. So, last year, I took the bold step of trying my hand at public speaking. I joined the Debate Club in my college. Since then, I have participated in multiple contests. Initially, I stammered, forgot my lines, dropped the microphone once due to my sweaty palms and even got booed at or scolded by the judges. Yet, I kept on participating. Last month, for the very first time in a year, I won the third prize. It was a great boost to my self-confidence. I believe that it is my greatest feat so far, even bigger than my award performance.”- A2.  
“In 2018, I was in the final year of college. During that time, I did three things to improve my knowledge. 1. I got myself enrolled in Aptech for the Sun Certified Java Programmer course. I will appear my exam soon. 2. I have bought magazine subscriptions such as Dataquest. These magazines help me to stay well informed about new topics in the IT world. 3. I completed my final year application project based on Java. The topic was Centralized Remote Based College Information Scheme.”
