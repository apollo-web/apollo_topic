### Talk about it
- Q1. What do you do when you know your boss is wrong?
　Or if you know your boss is 100% wrong about something, how would you handle this?- Q2. You have changed jobs/jumped ship too many times already, why so?
### Sample answers
- A1.  
“A few rare times in the past, I have spoken to a former supervisor about a particular error. Recently, my boss assigned our team a project. I knew the data he gave us was a couple of years old, and that there was more current data. Working with the most up-to-date information was vital to the success of the project. I went into my boss’s office and spoke to him privately about the error, merely showing him the most recent data. He thanked me and immediately updated the information. We completed the project with great success.”- A2.  
“You may label me a ‘frequent career-changer’ but I genuinely feel that today I am a far better employee. My switches have helped me develop better interpersonal skills, gain diverse skills and adapt to rapidly changing business environments. I can solve problems more efficiently and creatively, as I have learned to live with ambiguity and uncertainty. My first job helped me develop patience. My second job helped me master spreadsheets and numbers. My third job helped me develop better people skills and also adjust amidst culturally diverse and geographically dispersed teams. All in all, I feel that my varied background makes me an ideal candidate for this job role today.”
