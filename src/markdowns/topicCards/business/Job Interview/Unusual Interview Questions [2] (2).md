### Talk about it
- Q1. What was the last gift you gave someone? (asked by Gallup for Data Analysts)- Q2. How many square feet of pizza are eaten in the U.S. each year?
### Sample answers
- A1.  
"My brother loves baseball, so a couple weeks ago I bought him tickets to a Red Sox game"- A2.  
"Well, a pizza is roughly one square foot. If the average American eats one-third a pizza, and eats pizza three times a month, that would mean 12 square foot a year. Then, multiply that number by 200 million Americans, and you get 2.4 billion square feet."
