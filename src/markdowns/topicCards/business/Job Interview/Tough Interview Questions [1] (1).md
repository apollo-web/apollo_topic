### Talk about it
- Q1. Are you willing to fail?- Q2. If you could relive the last 10 years of your life, what would you do?
### Sample answers
- A1.  
　“While I don’t enjoy failure, sometimes it happens ? particularly when you’re not sure which approach would be best for a project and you choose the wrong one. Not everything you try is going to work, and you just have to accept this and know when to change course. I learned this for the first time when, as a new project manager at Building Designers, I was tasked with coordinating the installation of a green HVAC system in a historic hotel. It became clear, after construction started, that the materials we were using would lead to a substantial cost overrun ? so I had to resort to my “Plan B” in order to provide the deliverables we’d promised. One should always have a Plan B!”- A2.  
“The last 10 years have been the most exciting of my life, and I wouldn’t change a thing. I’ve been blessed in that I’ve had so many opportunities to learn and to grow both as a professional and as a person, first in college and then in my first job at ABC Corporation.”
