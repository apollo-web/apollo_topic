### Talk about it
- Q1. Why do you want to work for us or our company? or Why do you want this job?- Q2. Why should we hire you? Or why do you think you can fit well into the position?
### Sample answers
- A1.  
“I read an article in the newspaper a few months back. The news piece revolved around your corporate community service. I am not exactly a philanthropist, as I am not that rich yet, but giving back is a big part of my personal philosophy. When I read that article, I was moved. The true excitement overtook me when I got this interview call. It will be really nice if I get to work in an organization, which follows the same philosophies as I personally do. Because my technical skills will be recognized in other places as well, but personal philosophies are equally important.”- A2.  
“Sir/Ma’am, I am confident about the fact that my strong technical experience and outstanding knowledge of SKILL1, SKILL2, and SKILL3 make me a strong contender for this position. I have been in this field for X years. I have got several to pick up skills, for example in my previous organization, I have completed an internal certification on SAP and supply chain management process. I have successfully executed projects right from inception to delivery. I must add that today I am sitting here because I strongly believe this is the right place to extend my skills. This might be excellent for my future and for the growth of this esteemed organization as well.”
