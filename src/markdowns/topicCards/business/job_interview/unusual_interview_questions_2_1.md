### Talk about it
- Q1. How much do you charge to wash every window in Seattle?- Q2. How many pennies would fit into this room? (asked by Ipreo for Product Analyst)
### Sample answers
- A1.  
"Well, let's say Seattle consists of 10,000 city blocks, with 1,000 windows per block. That's 10 million windows. If I charge $5 per window, I'd make $50 million."
  - A2a.  
"I'd need to measure how many pennies fit length-wise, width-wise, and height-wise. Then I'd simply multiply those three numbers." 
  - A2b.  
"Well, will this room still have furniture in it, or would we remove it? Also, what's the volume of the room? Once I have that information, I could do the math based on the volume of a penny."
