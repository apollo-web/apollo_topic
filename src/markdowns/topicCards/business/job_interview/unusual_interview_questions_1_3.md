### Talk about it
- Q1. We finish the interview and you step outside the office and find a lottery ticket that ends up winning $10 million. What would you do?
- Q2. If you had to be shipwrecked on a deserted island, but all your human needs?such as food and water?were 
taken care of, what two items would you want to have with you? (asked by Yahoo)
### Sample answers
- A1.  
"I'd use the $10 million to travel, donate to charity, and provide for my family. However, I'd still want to work for your company. I've always enjoyed working in marketing, and I think this company puts a great emphasis on creativity and storytelling to help brands' spread their message. So while I'd love to get $10 million, it wouldn't change my career goals."
- A2.  
"I'd like to bring a wifi-enabled laptop with wind generator to charge the batteries, and a lighter. I can do my work and keep in contact with friends on my laptop, and I can use the lighter to start fires and keep warm at night."
