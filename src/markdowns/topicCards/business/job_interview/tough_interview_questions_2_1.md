### Talk about it
- Q1. What strategies would you use to motivate your team?
- Q2. How would you handle it if there was a problem with a member of your team not doing their fair share or work?
### Sample answers
- A1.  
“Most people, even when they love their job, want to be noticed and appreciated for the work they do. I make it a point to recognize my team members’ contributions both privately, with informal “thank you” emails, and publicly during weekly staff meetings.”
- A2.  
“I would first talk to them privately in a non-confrontational manner, using “I” statements to suggest that there might be a problem that we should resolve together. I’d also do my best to determine the root of the issue and to see if I or other team members could improve this person’s productivity. This approach works for me about 95% of the time; in cases where it doesn’t, I ask for a private consultation with my supervisor to brainstorm other solutions.”
